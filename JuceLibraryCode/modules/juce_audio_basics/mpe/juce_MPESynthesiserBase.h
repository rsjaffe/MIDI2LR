/**
    Derive from this class to create a basic audio generator capable of MPE.
    Implement the callbacks of MPEInstrument::Listener (noteAdded, notePressureChanged
    etc.) to let your audio generator know that MPE notes were triggered, modulated,
    or released. What to do inside them, and how that influences your audio generator,
    is up to you!

    This class uses an instance of MPEInstrument internally to handle the MPE
    note state logic.

    This class is a very low-level base class for an MPE instrument. If you need
    something more sophisticated, have a look at MPESynthesiser. This class extends
    MPESynthesiserBase by adding the concept of voices that can play notes,
    a voice stealing algorithm, and much more.

        MPE notes, zones etc. MIDI messages not relevant for MPE are ignored.

        This method can be overridden if you need to do custom MIDI handling
        on top of MPE. The MPESynthesiser class overrides this to implement
        callbacks for MIDI program changes and non-MPE-related MIDI controller

        When rendering, the audio blocks that are passed into renderNextBlock() will be split up
        into smaller blocks that lie between all the incoming midi messages, and it is these smaller
        sub-blocks that are rendered with multiple calls to renderVoices().

        Obviously in a pathological case where there are midi messages on every sample, then
        renderVoices() could be called once per sample and lead to poor performance, so this
        setting allows you to set a lower limit on the block size.

        The default setting is 32, which means that midi messages are accurate to about < 1ms
        accuracy, which is probably fine for most purposes, but you may want to increase or
        decrease this value for your synth.

        If shouldBeStrict is true, the audio sub-blocks will strictly never be smaller than numSamples.

        If shouldBeStrict is false (default), the first audio sub-block in the buffer is allowed
        to be smaller, to make sure that the first MIDI event in a buffer will always be sample-accurate
        (this can sometimes help to avoid quantisation or phasing issues).
