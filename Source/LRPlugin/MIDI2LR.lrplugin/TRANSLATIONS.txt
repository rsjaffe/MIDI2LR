I'm adding translation of menu items for the Lightroom plugin (but not the app). I 
need assistance for the following languages:
* Chinese (Simplified)
* Chinese (Traditional)
* Swedish
* Korean
* Japanese

To provide a translation for the project, look at TranslatedString_en.txt. That lists
all strings that need translation into other languages.

Each line in the file is formatted like "$$$/MIDI2LR/Stuff/name=The text to translate".
Leave everything to the left of the = sign alone, and replace the text to the right of 
the = sign with the translation. If you see a ^ sign followed by a number in the string, 
leave that alone as well--that gets replaced with a calculated value in the program. No 
newline characters or comments are allowed. The strings in this file must all be enclosed 
with double quotes. If you're wondering what a translated file looks like, compare 
TranslatedStrings_en.txt with TranslatedStrings_de.txt.

Send any translations to me at rsjaffe@gmail.com. Thanks for your assistance!

The following text editors are recommended for editing these files:

In Mac OS X simply use TextEdit and make sure you save the file type as “UTF-8” 
(rather than UTF-16 or UCS-2, for instance).

In Windows use Notepad, and be sure to save the file as type “UTF-8.”
